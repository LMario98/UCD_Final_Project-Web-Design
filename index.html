            <h2>Football Club Internazionale Milano</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1908 following a schism within the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan), Inter won
                its first championship in 1910. Since its formation, the club has won 36 domestic trophies, including
                twenty league titles, nine Coppa Italia, and eight Supercoppa Italiana. From 2006 to 2010, the club won
                five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record at that time.[12] They have won the
                European Cup/Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965, and then another in 2010.
                Their latest win completed an unprecedented Italian seasonal treble, with Inter winning the Coppa Italia
                and the Scudetto the same year.[13] The club has also won three UEFA Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and
                one FIFA Club World Cup.
                Inter's home games are played at the San Siro stadium, which they share with city rivals AC Milan. The
                stadium is the largest in Italian football with a capacity of 75,817.[14].</p>
            <p>Foundation and early years (1908-1960),This wonderful night will give us the colours of our crest: black
                and blue against a backdrop of stars. It shall be called International, because we are brothers of the
                world.</p>
